=Getting Started=

1. Checkout the latest build from trunk.

2. Import the project into Eclipse as a Java project.

3. Compile the project, if needed.

4. Create a run configuration with a main pointing to FastHDR.java and VM arguments: -vmargs -Xmx1024M (this maybe increased or decreased depending on your image sizes)

5. Run the application. A window should be displayed. Use File->Open to open any .hdr or .pfs file.
